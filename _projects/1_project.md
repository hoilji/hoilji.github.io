    <h4>Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)</h4>
    <p>
SOFC is a high-temperature fuel cell that uses ceramic components as the electrolyte and electrodes.
Operating above 700 °C, it offers high electrical efficiency, fuel flexibility, and excellent suitability for combined heat and power systems.
SOFC technology is already being commercialized with a rapidly growing market, while scale-up, cost reduction, and long-term reliability remain key research challenges.

    <h4>Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC)</h4>
    <p>
SOEC is a high-temperature electrolysis technology that efficiently converts steam and/or CO₂ into hydrogen or syngas.
Thanks to its high operating temperature, SOEC achieves the highest electrical efficiency among water electrolysis technologies and is well suited for integration with renewable energy and waste heat.
Current research focuses on durability, thermal management, and system integration for large-scale hydrogen production.

    <h4>Proton-Conducting Fuel Cell (PCFC)</h4>
<p>
PCFC employs proton-conducting ceramic electrolytes and operates at intermediate temperatures below 600 °C.
It combines the advantages of high efficiency, reduced degradation, and the ability to use dry fuels without external humidification.
PCFC is an emerging technology with strong potential, while material stability, electrode kinetics, and long-term performance are active research topics.

    <h4>Proton-Conducting Electrolysis Cell (PCEC)</h4>
<p>
PCEC is the electrolysis counterpart of PCFC, producing hydrogen through proton transport at intermediate temperatures.
It enables highly efficient hydrogen production with lower thermal requirements compared to SOEC and can directly generate dry hydrogen.
Key challenges include large-area cell fabrication, stack development, and long-term durability under realistic operating conditions.
